# TicTacToe-AI
An undefeatable tictactoe program written using the mini-max algorithm to observe future moves to choose the best current move. The bot looks into all possible future moves available and chooses the move which maximises its chance of winning and minimizes the opponents chance of winning. Use the windows-installer if you simply want to try the game for fun.
